    <h2>About Nala</h2>

    <p>Nala is a Jack Russel Terrier breed of dog. She is my favorite all time and my bestfriend</p>
    <p>Nala likes wagging her tail anytime she's excited or see a friendly human. She is friendly herself. Sometimes Nala gets lonely and you can know this when you see her body shaking or shivering.</p>
    <p>Her favorite things throughout the day include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Chasing cars along the fence.</li>
        <li>Barking to birds and strange animals</li>
        <li>Being pet on the back and stomach</li>
        <li>Meal time</li>

      </ul>
    <p>Hmm, what does Nala play with?</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Balls and anything round</li>
        <li>Shoes, sandals and slippers</li>
        <li>Bone</li>
      </ol>
